# Extempore

![`master` branch: build & test](https://github.com/digego/extempore/workflows/Build%20&%20run%20tests/badge.svg?branch=master)

![Latest release](https://github.com/digego/extempore/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

A programming environment for cyberphysical programming.

## Getting started

### The easy way

Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install the Extempore
extension and then use the _Extempore: Download binary_ command to do the rest.

For more details, head to the [Quickstart
page](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/overview/quickstart/) in Extempore's
online docs.

### The _slightly_ harder way (for those who don't want to use VSCode)

Download the latest [binary
release](https://github.com/digego/extempore/releases) for your platform, unzip
it and run `extempore` (`extempore.exe` on Windows) from inside the `extempore`
folder.

Then, [set up your text editor of
choice](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/guides/editor-support/) and away
you go.

### The "hard" way: build from source

This will download and build all the dependencies you need (including LLVM). So,
if you've got a C++ compiler (for `gcc`, version 4.9 or later is required), git
and CMake, here are some one-liner build commands:

On **Linux/macOS**:

    git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore && mkdir extempore/build && cd extempore/build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install
    
On **Windows** (if you're using VS2017---adjust as necessary for your VS
version):

    git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore && mkdir extempore/build && cd extempore/build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 .. && cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release

If you have problems, check out the platform-specific build notes below.

#### Build options

If you're using the CMake GUI, then these will appear as checkboxes/drop-down
menus. If you're using CMake from the CLI, then remember that you specify
options using the `-DOPTION_NAME=OPTION_VALUE` syntax.

Here are a few of the more interesting CMake options:

- `ASSETS` (boolean, default `ON`) will download the Extempore binary assets
  (required for many of the examples), so as long as you're ok with a ~300MB
  download during the build process then add the `-DASSETS=ON` CMake option to
  the above build commands

- `BUILD_DEPS` (boolean, default `ON`) controls whether or not the build process
  will also download and build the extended libraries (e.g. glfw, libsndfile).
  If you want to get those things through another package manager (or not use
  them at all) then set this to `OFF`.

- `EXTERNAL_SHLIBS_AUDIO`/`EXTERNAL_SHLIBS_GRAPHICS` (boolean, default `ON` for
  both) are useful if you want to build the supporting libs for graphics/audio
  but not both (so you should set the one you *don't* want to `OFF`)

- `PACKAGE` (boolean, default `OFF`) prepares everything (including all extended
  deps and AOT-compilation) to create a zipfile for binary distribution. The
  main effect of this flag is to disable processor-specific optimisations for
  all the build commands, which gives you the best chance of producing a
  portable binary. This option also adds a `package` target to the
  makefile/solution, which can be used to actually generate the zipfile/dmg/deb.

#### Build targets

The default target will build Extempore, all the dependencies, and AOT-compile
the standard library (for faster startup). However, in other situations the
following targets might come in handy:

- on macOS and Linux, the `install` target will move the extempore executable to
  `/usr/local/bin` (or similar) and the rest of the Extempore share directory to
  `/usr/local/share/extempore` (does nothing on Windows)

- the `aot` target will ahead-of-time compile just the core standard library,
  i.e. the pure-xtlang libraries with no external C library dependencies

- the `clean_aot` target will remove all AOT-compiled files

- the `assets` target won't build anything per. se., but it will download the
  assets e.g. sound files, 3D model files which are referenced in the examples
  (it's pretty big, so make sure you're on an internet connection where you
  don't mind downloading a bunch of data)

#### Platform-specific notes

##### macOS

On **macOS 10.14** (Mojave) Apple removed some of the system OpenGL headers,
which means that some of Extempore's dependencies (e.g. nanovg) won't build.
[This blog
post](https://silvae86.github.io/sysadmin/mac/osx/mojave/beta/libxml2/2018/07/05/fixing-missing-headers-for-homebrew-in-mac-osx-mojave/)
has more details, but if you just want a one-liner to fix it, it's

    sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /

##### Linux

Extempore is built & tested on Ubuntu, but is also known to work with Debian,
Fedora, Arch, and also inside a docker container.

There are a few extra dependencies which you may need to get through your
package manager. For example, on Ubuntu 20.04:

    sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

##### Windows

Extempore is built & tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio v15 (2017) and
Visual Studio v16 (2019). If you don't already have VS installed, you can
download the free [Visual Studio
Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)---that's
perfectly fine for building Extempore (although the paid versions of VS will
work as well).

If you don't want to use the the command-line described
[above](#build-from-source), note that Visual Studio has pretty good CMake
integration these days.

If you want to use the **ASIO** audio backend on Windows (which _might_ give you
lower-latency audio, or it might not) you need to download the [ASIO
SDK](http://www.steinberg.net/nc/en/company/developer/sdk_download_portal.html)
from Steinberg. You have to create a [third party developer
account](http://www.steinberg.net/nc/en/company/developer/sdk_download_portal/create_3rd_party_developer_account.html),
then you can log in and download the ASIO SDK (make sure you get the right SDK).
You also need to download and install [ASIO4ALL](http://www.asio4all.com/) with
the 'offline setup panel' option enabled. After that, copy the ASIO files into
the `src/portaudio/src/hostapi/asio`, and use the `-DASIO=ON` CMake option.
